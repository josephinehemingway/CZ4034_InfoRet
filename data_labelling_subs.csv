440,zcgf2u,The Twitter / Musk Arb Trade,"Hey folks,

I'm not sure if you might be interested in a podcast that details the saga of the Twitter purchase and the drama around Elon's acquisition of the platform. I interviewed two investors who were long Twitter during the legal battle, along with a lawyer that covers the Delaware Court of Chancery.

I think that the real key to the trade was to see Elon for who he really is, and not a caricature that has been cooked up by either his fans or haters. Also, as I mention in the episode, I think Elon made the trade especially fun.

I'm curious if any of the people on this sub got involved in this trade, since you likely have a lot of Elon-relevant knowledge that would have been pretty important.

The story kind of begins in January of this year and then concludes in late October, so it doesn't cover anything that's happened since he closed. Seems like it's way too early to really know what will happen with the site. Would love to see him bring the company public again so that all of the hot-take artists could either bet on the future of the company, or shut up. There's just a lot of bluster from people who have injected their wishes for what will happen into their analysis of the costs/revenue stuff.

(Outside of this episode my show more generally deals with risk takers, like gamblers and investors).

828,ykvi1o,All this hate for Elon,"I used to and still like Elon, I've followed him for a while now and although he does a do questionable things from time to time, he doesn't deserve all the hate he now gets on reddit. Most people used to like him, he wasn't a fake billionaire and never had a PR team, so he's authentic. He's also relatable and has a fantastic sense of humour. All you'd need to do is watch him on a recent podcast to see all he wants to do is make life better for humanity. 

So why all the Elon hate? I've watched the general opinion of reddit change so drastically over the last year or so. My friend, who also liked Elon, said he's beginning to change his opinion. I asked him what changed in the last year and he said he didn't know. I think reddit is a great platform for warping the opinion of the masses.

509,z76ier,"Elon may be actually able to build his own phone, with blackjack and tweets","So, a few days ago Elon tweeted that he may consider making his own phone. How realistic is the idea?

I did a bit of research, and was surprised to learn how close is SpaceX to making a phone. 

Firstly, Starlink terminals are basically satellite phones. Sure, they're bulky, but the core functionality is the same.

Secondly, SpaceX has already made some steps into this direction. A few months ago (August 2022), SpaceX announced a partnership with T-Mobile, the second-largest wireless carrier in the US. Judging by the announcements, SpaceX wants to add some cellular connectivity to Starlink terminals.

Thirdly, cellular phones is not a rocket science (heh). It's an old tech. You can build your own phone with a few cheap off-the-shelf components. The phone will be bulky and will look like a DIY contraption, but it will work. There are dozens of manuals on how to do that. 

Fourthly, there are several small companies that make high-quality open-source cell phones (this includes open-source hardware). SpaceX can adopt their specs, or buy the entire company.
