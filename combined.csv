OpenAI is working on a tool to watermark AI-generated text to prevent misuse. The watermark uses a cryptographic pseudorandom function to add an unnoticeable signal to the text.

Look crypto bros, **CRYPTOgraphy** lets spam Twitter with this as a Use case (sarcasm)

In basic terms: Open AI is adding a watermark to text generated from GPT, so it's easier to spot AI-generated works.

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI‚Äôs GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

*not AI toying with students‚Äô emotions üò≠*

It was a dark and stormy night, and Elon Musk sat alone in his laboratory, hunched over a table filled with strange and exotic equipment. For weeks, he had been working on a secret project, fueled by his insatiable hunger for power and his desire to push the boundaries of science and technology.

As the storm raged outside, Musk's eyes glowed with a mad light as he mixed and measured various chemicals and compounds, his hands moving with the precision of a surgeon. Finally, with a triumphant grin, he poured the last of the ingredients into a glowing beaker and watched as it began to bubble and hiss.

""At last,"" he whispered, ""the elixir of life. The key to unlocking the limitless energy of the human soul.""

With a trembling hand, he lifted the beaker to his lips and drank the glowing liquid, feeling its power surge through his veins. In an instant, he was transformed, his senses heightened and his body infused with a new and terrifying strength.

But as he looked around his laboratory, he realized that he was not alone. The storm had brought with it a group of unsuspecting victims, and as they stumbled into the room, they were met with the horrifying sight of Elon Musk, his eyes glowing with a demonic light as he lunged at them, his teeth bared in a twisted grin.

""You will be my energy,"" he snarled, as he began to feast on the flesh of the terrified people, his hunger growing with each bite.

In the end, no one was able to stop him, and Elon Musk continued his reign of terror, feeding on the people of the world in his quest for limitless power. And as he grew stronger and more powerful, he became a monster, a creature of pure evil that only the bravest and strongest could hope to defeat.",Elon musks quest for human power,"

The largest takeaway from the ongoing Twitter Files, that I don't hear being talked about, is that it points to a need for nation states to amend or implement **digital rights** related to social media.

As it stands now, Twitter is a company, and they ott to be allowed to support whatever political ideology their employees, managers, shareholder, etc... believe in.  Just like, if coke wanted to support one candidate and Pepsi wanted to support the other, that's their own prerogative.

I see an issue with that though, Coke and Pepsi, their product is sugar water... Whereas the product of Twitter, Facebook and other Social Media platforms is for better lack of a word: ""A digital representation of a public space"".

* A Tweet or Reddit post is similar to having a conversation in a park.

Would it not be wise, to transcribe and patch this freedom to fit in with the modern digital world of today?

Hey folks,

I'm not sure if you might be interested in a podcast that details the saga of the Twitter purchase and the drama around Elon's acquisition of the platform. I interviewed two investors who were long Twitter during the legal battle, along with a lawyer that covers the Delaware Court of Chancery.

I think that the real key to the trade was to see Elon for who he really is, and not a caricature that has been cooked up by either his fans or haters. Also, as I mention in the episode, I think Elon made the trade especially fun.

I'm curious if any of the people on this sub got involved in this trade, since you likely have a lot of Elon-relevant knowledge that would have been pretty important.

The story kind of begins in January of this year and then concludes in late October, so it doesn't cover anything that's happened since he closed. Seems like it's way too early to really know what will happen with the site. Would love to see him bring the company public again so that all of the hot-take artists could either bet on the future of the company, or shut up. There's just a lot of bluster from people who have injected their wishes for what will happen into their analysis of the costs/revenue stuff.

(Outside of this episode my show more generally deals with risk takers, like gamblers and investors).

So, a few days ago Elon tweeted that he may consider making his own phone. How realistic is the idea?

I did a bit of research, and was surprised to learn how close is SpaceX to making a phone. 

Firstly, Starlink terminals are basically satellite phones. Sure, they're bulky, but the core functionality is the same.

Secondly, SpaceX has already made some steps into this direction. A few months ago (August 2022), SpaceX announced a partnership with T-Mobile, the second-largest wireless carrier in the US. Judging by the announcements, SpaceX wants to add some cellular connectivity to Starlink terminals.

Thirdly, cellular phones is not a rocket science (heh). It's an old tech. You can build your own phone with a few cheap off-the-shelf components. The phone will be bulky and will look like a DIY contraption, but it will work. There are dozens of manuals on how to do that. 

Fourthly, there are several small companies that make high-quality open-source cell phones (this includes open-source hardware). SpaceX can adopt their specs, or buy the entire company.

z4cfi6,25/11/22 12:39,"Consquences of The Twitter Deal

 If Twitter somehow survives this, he then has to deal with the shitload of liability that the non GDPR compliant, unsecured website will bring him. If Twitter just crashes, and that's it, it would be a blessing in disguise for Elon. If Twitter survives for much longer, more than just his poorly leveraged debt, will kick his ass.   


 

His Twitter ownership is back by leveraged Tesla shares. If Twitter crashes, his creditors get his Tesla shares. If *Tesla* crashes, Twitter's debt becomes even more difficult to service and his creditors may demand even more Tesla shares. Basically, if *anything* crashes, Elon is fucked. If everything, by some miracle, survives, then Twitter is still stuck with its insane debt service obligations, and basically acts like an anchor around Elon's neck, since it'll keep Twitter from turning any serious profits.

And given his management of Twitter so far, there is a possibility, albeit remote, that large stakeholders might be able to argue Elon managed Twitter in bad faith as the CEO - which could let them ""pierce the vail"", to go after Elon's personal wealth directly, in the event of a bankruptcy of Twitter.

Oh, and none of this even touches upon what kind of impact this might have on Elon's management/ownership of SpaceX. All those deals are private. All we can reasonably infer is that SpaceX isn't turning a profit (because if it were, Elon and the other investors would be taking it public so they could get their return on investment). For all we know, the Twitter deal is backed with SpaceX shares, too. Or there could be stipulations in SpaceX's charter, or Elon's contract, that could see him lose control of SpaceX if Twitter goes sideways.  


 Spacex is pretty much just funded by the government as a fucking handout lol  so we don't need to talk about that  


 And SpaceX going public would be the worst thing at this point in time. Part of what makes them so unique and successful is their ability to rapidly iterate on the fly (pun maybe intended) via testing to failure (and they're not afraid to fail) without fear of repercussions by shareholders. We have the luxury of following practically every move SpaceX is making for Starship development in South Texas including vehicle design, testing, and sometimes destructive testing. This is incredibly rare in that industry.

z15n0p,21/11/22 18:08,"Just some facts around large-scale systems

First some disclaimers:

1. I have never worked for Twitter and outside of running into some of their folks in conferences, I have no direct knowledge of anyone there.
2. I am not interested in speculating what will be the future of the platform, I am just seeing a huge amount of misinformed opinions and I thought I can offer my perspective as someone who has worked on large-scale systems their whole career.

Cool?

Alright so let's start with a comment on Twitter being bloated. I have no knowledge of their organizational structure and I think it's a safe assumption to say that neither most people commenting one way or another. I can say with certainty that Twitter did not have 7500 engineers. Probably less than half of that number were involved in anything directly technical, and the rest were supporting and business departments (like marketing, legal, compliance, support, vendor and customer relations, HR, training, etc. etc.).

Several thousand people may seem a lot until you realize the scope of this operation. This is a global company with datacenters around the world. I would guess 3 in the US ~~(minimally 2 West and East) and minimally 1 in Europe, 1 in India and at least 1 in Asia maybe Singapore...If they had a presence in China they would also have at least a dedicated datacenter there too.~~

`Edit: I know no one comes back to read these things, but for the sake accuracy I looked up Twitter's infrastructure and from what I can find they have 3 physical datacenters in the US and contracts with AWS and Google(GCP).` 

The technical groups would also be separated into specialists. Frond-end development is fundamentally different than backend development which is fundamentally different than operations such as network and infrastructure. Those teams would also split into specialists for each platform. Android, iOS and browser would have their own dedicated teams, probably multiple of each as the engineers are also rarely experts in UIX for example. There would be multiple teams dedicated to analytics for business and operational purposes staffed with data scientists. Security definitely had its own organization with perhaps also divided between security development and security operations. How large each organization was would depend on how much custom security solutions they developed vs. using known products.

For every critical function and interface, ideally you need separate teams and people for both security and speed. You cannot rely on a single person for a critical function because things happen to people...they get sick, they get hit by busses, they have kids, they might even want to go on vacation.

I can go on, however the point I wanted to make is that it's not so simple throwing numbers around about how many people are needed to both run and enhance that platform. Maybe the layoffs and resignations were even across everything, maybe they were only targeted for certain teams. If the numbers are indeed upwards of 80 to 90% across all teams, then the development speed and perhaps operational stability may be at risk, even if there are still people who can handle each are, if they are the only ones left with their expertise, it's a huge risk to the organization. You never want to be one-deep on any given area.

I won't go into much of the discussion about twitter still being the same since the layoffs because that's just silly. The people working there weren't hamsters on wheels that once they left the wheels would immediately stop spinning. The clues about the health of the systems will be revealed in the coming weeks and months. In operations when the next outage happens. We will see the root cause and how long it will take to resolve. In security, same deal. In development we will see how new features are rolled out and whether they are buggy, etc. and of course in the long run we will see how those things are addressed and whether they are improving.

=============================

On the technical side there is just a tsunami of bad takes from ""put it on the cloud"" to ""this is a simple app"" and I feel that they fall into fundamentally 3 categories of people (if I exclude those who are trolling):

1. Non-IT people making comments from their experience as a user
2. IT people who haven't worked on globally large-scale systems
3. Non-Technical IT people who may have worked on large-scale systems but from a management perspective or never had to solve for the engineering problems at that scale.

This topic alone could fill a dozen books, but let me just say that any simple operation scaled to several billion operations per hour across the globe is not trivial to solve and will break in very unexpected ways. There are also counter-intuitive scenarios where systems which are optimized for speed at that scale will actually become **slower** if the call volume is decreased. There isn't a single person or skillset which can solve this on their own, you need deep experts in network, in storage, in cashing, in several specific RFCs and this isn't something that is taught in schools because it's only useful for less than 100 companies worldwide. It's actually a huge testament to the geniuses who came up with the original specifications for things like HTTP because they never envisioned in their wildest dreams how the internet would evolve and the fact these protocols have been able to (mostly) scale to this level is honestly mind-blowing. It's like if the Wright Brothers' initial engine design could be used almost unchanged in today's fighter jets.

`Edit: One more edit here since I got called out on my tech geekiness and I didn't have a chance to respond to that comment before the user deleted it.

This is already a huge wall of text so I don't want to geek out over the technical section (I am happy to if anyone has questions in the comments), but I wanted to especially call this out for my IT brothers and sisters because some of these comments make you look foolish to those with experience in these fields.",Just some facts around large-scale systems,"First some disclaimers:

1. I have never worked for Twitter and outside of running into some of their folks in conferences, I have no direct knowledge of anyone there.
2. I am not interested in speculating what will be the future of the platform, I am just seeing a huge amount of misinformed opinions and I thought I can offer my perspective as someone who has worked on large-scale systems their whole career.

Cool?

Alright so let's start with a comment on Twitter being bloated. I have no knowledge of their organizational structure and I think it's a safe assumption to say that neither most people commenting one way or another. I can say with certainty that Twitter did not have 7500 engineers. Probably less than half of that number were involved in anything directly technical, and the rest were supporting and business departments (like marketing, legal, compliance, support, vendor and customer relations, HR, training, etc. etc.).

Several thousand people may seem a lot until you realize the scope of this operation. This is a global company with datacenters around the world. I would guess 3 in the US ~~(minimally 2 West and East) and minimally 1 in Europe, 1 in India and at least 1 in Asia maybe Singapore...If they had a presence in China they would also have at least a dedicated datacenter there too.~~

`Edit: I know no one comes back to read these things, but for the sake accuracy I looked up Twitter's infrastructure and from what I can find they have 3 physical datacenters in the US and contracts with AWS and Google(GCP).` 

The technical groups would also be separated into specialists. Frond-end development is fundamentally different than backend development which is fundamentally different than operations such as network and infrastructure. Those teams would also split into specialists for each platform. Android, iOS and browser would have their own dedicated teams, probably multiple of each as the engineers are also rarely experts in UIX for example. There would be multiple teams dedicated to analytics for business and operational purposes staffed with data scientists. Security definitely had its own organization with perhaps also divided between security development and security operations. How large each organization was would depend on how much custom security solutions they developed vs. using known products.

For every critical function and interface, ideally you need separate teams and people for both security and speed. You cannot rely on a single person for a critical function because things happen to people...they get sick, they get hit by busses, they have kids, they might even want to go on vacation.

I can go on, however the point I wanted to make is that it's not so simple throwing numbers around about how many people are needed to both run and enhance that platform. Maybe the layoffs and resignations were even across everything, maybe they were only targeted for certain teams. If the numbers are indeed upwards of 80 to 90% across all teams, then the development speed and perhaps operational stability may be at risk, even if there are still people who can handle each are, if they are the only ones left with their expertise, it's a huge risk to the organization. You never want to be one-deep on any given area.

I won't go into much of the discussion about twitter still being the same since the layoffs because that's just silly. The people working there weren't hamsters on wheels that once they left the wheels would immediately stop spinning. The clues about the health of the systems will be revealed in the coming weeks and months. In operations when the next outage happens. We will see the root cause and how long it will take to resolve. In security, same deal. In development we will see how new features are rolled out and whether they are buggy, etc. and of course in the long run we will see how those things are addressed and whether they are improving.

=============================

On the technical side there is just a tsunami of bad takes from ""put it on the cloud"" to ""this is a simple app"" and I feel that they fall into fundamentally 3 categories of people (if I exclude those who are trolling):

1. Non-IT people making comments from their experience as a user
2. IT people who haven't worked on globally large-scale systems
3. Non-Technical IT people who may have worked on large-scale systems but from a management perspective or never had to solve for the engineering problems at that scale.

This topic alone could fill a dozen books, but let me just say that any simple operation scaled to several billion operations per hour across the globe is not trivial to solve and will break in very unexpected ways. There are also counter-intuitive scenarios where systems which are optimized for speed at that scale will actually become **slower** if the call volume is decreased. There isn't a single person or skillset which can solve this on their own, you need deep experts in network, in storage, in cashing, in several specific RFCs and this isn't something that is taught in schools because it's only useful for less than 100 companies worldwide. It's actually a huge testament to the geniuses who came up with the original specifications for things like HTTP because they never envisioned in their wildest dreams how the internet would evolve and the fact these protocols have been able to (mostly) scale to this level is honestly mind-blowing. It's like if the Wright Brothers' initial engine design could be used almost unchanged in today's fighter jets.

`Edit: One more edit here since I got called out on my tech geekiness and I didn't have a chance to respond to that comment before the user deleted it. There are indeed different kinds of network experts and I don't pretend to be a network engineer, I have to call on the adults when it comes to WAN specific considerations.` 

`Also, when I mention expertise in RFCs I was just simplifying because no one is interested in reading another 4 paragraphs on how do you go about designing and implementing a custom solution based on an RFC specification while also being aware of the 19 other vendors who have done the same but all in slightly different ways and will sit there and play dumb when you tell them that actually they aren't spec compliant since they aren't including an attribute that is marked as MANDATORY by the spec.`

Federal minimum wage is currently sitting at $7.25 an hour in the U.S. and if you worked a full time 40 hour a week job that roughly translates to around $15,080 a year.

If you never rose above that wage you would end up making $633,360 in 42 years, which is the average amount of time a person tends to work in U.S. currently.

At that rate Elon could have paid the entire life time of 69,470 workers wages, that's nearly the entire population of Canton Ohio.

When he said he would make Twitter more transparent and open source some of the Tweet promotion algorithms, it sounded like the democratic dream of free software advocates - moving in the opposite direction of Facebook, a tool that uses you, Twitter could become a neutral tool, a service, which you have way more freedom, clarity, control and understanding about how it works, what the rules are, and have the freedom to navigate those rules more to your own liking, like maybe finding ways to filter out content you don‚Äôt want to see.

As soon as he took over I was as excited and inspired as ever before. I think I saw that Twitter already changed its moderation a bit, like publically posting the actual rules behind moderation and so on? (Or was that there before?)

Every one of his Tweets talking about his plans has made good sense to me. He‚Äôs one of the most accomplished businesspeople in the world. The second he lands, it‚Äôs like, the master is here, let‚Äôs see how he does things differently. He establishes a new committee which is based on way more systematic and philosophical principles for what should be moderated and why. He realizes there are severe economic problems in the company‚Äôs functioning and takes bold, fearless, drastic changes like immediately establishing a new revenue stream (Twitter Blue) and slashing deadweight, literally firing half the staff and multiple executives whose work style he doesn‚Äôt like.

This is a company in the hands of a master. It‚Äôs like when you wonder how a three star Michelin chef cooks an omelette. You will always be surprised because in some ways it might surprise you that it‚Äôs quite simple, but you are aware how every choice they make speaks to how deliberate their choices are, how authentic, drawing from deep internal thought processes.

I have been weirdly taken aback seeing consistently negative press about this. Late night talk show hosts, New York Times, and others, are peddling a story that seems like political tribalism because their constituency wants to be anti-billionaires or something. They keep reporting on the rise in extremism and misinformation, apparently condemnable or random actions like firing a lot of staff, or even just making fun of his ‚Äúsink‚Äù pun.

Is there any newspaper putting this in a positive light? I would like to see a story instead about Musk‚Äôs vision, Musk‚Äôs decisions and why he says they will be beneficial.",Any newspapers reflecting Musk running Twitter positively?,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of Elon Musk, I feel like when you hear him talk, hear his ideas and viewpoints, and see the things he‚Äôs done, you feel like he‚Äôs a person that‚Äôs actually thinking rigorously and systematically and is a very creative problem solver who analyzes a situation extremely thoroughly to try to figure out how to resolve obstructions and make significant leaps of progress.

Coverage places are 30...60...180...560 places, but at the same time his houses are not released. One of the platforms is considered to be the created meta universe, which is increasingly entering modern life.

The main effect of presence is the ability to hear the audience as in a regular cinema hall, while enjoying the sound and picture of new movies without leaving home.

 This program implies the participation and involvement of both an audience with little knowledge of advanced technologies, and an audience that is passionate about the latest technologies and fashions of modern society.

  It is also planned to cooperate with major streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon prime, Hulu and information technology companies Meta Platforms ink., Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft. 

The development of the  project is expected, this is the distribution of technical kits and software for using the possibilities of online attractions without involving the meta universe, via the Internet.

You can also use ""smart sound speaker"" with software.

ykvpmv,3/11/22 7:57,"Why a Blue check mark is now $8 on Twitter and Elon Musk's Next Steps - A possible explanation:

Is it likely Twitter is eventually going to be a paid service for everyone, at a price-point much less than $8?

Currently there are about 300K verified accounts on Twitter. The $8 fee would bring in a paltry 2.4million dollars every month - pocket change for a company with a 5 billion dollar annual revenue. So is the charge levied so eventually millions of people will buy the blue check mark for $8 a month - who would pay such a sum for a service like Twitter? I don't think that's the game here.

Elon's number 1 concern with Twitter has been to first make it free of spams and bots. But it doesnt make sense to charge money to blue check accounts if the aim is to reduce the number of spam accounts -  the bot problem has never been with blue check accounts, which are more or less regulated in the public eye.

Well, perhaps the $8 charge is not supposed to bring in revenue, nor do away with the bot problem right now. Perhaps, all it is supposed to do at the moment is **create the idea first** among the general public **that Twitter is going to be a paid service.** **For everyone**. Obviously the charge for the general public later will not be $8. It will have to be much, much less, to the tune of a dollar per month or even less. After a section of Twitter has been paying $8 for a while, it will not seem too much for most of us to shell out a dollar a month. It will seem fair. So instead of making everyone pay at once at different tiers (which many wouldn't because right now it is given that Twitter is, and supposed to be, free), change the idea of Twitter first.

Charging everyone a minimum sub fee will help with the bot problem significantly, as one would have to shell out thousands or millions of dollar every month to keep spam operations going. It will also generate significant revenue for Twitter - if at least 250 million of Twitter's 450 million accounts currently are real, and at least a 100 million accounts stay after the subscription modality is introduced - that is still a 100 million dollars a month of clean revenue. That money can be used to pay content creators, and will pay for the regulation of spam accounts or actual hate speech, even more.

A win-win on both ends. Not sure if this is exactly what will happen, but speculative business non-fiction is a fun genre!",Why a Blue check mark is now $8 on Twitter and Elon Musk's Next Steps - A possible explanation:,"Is it likely Twitter is eventually going to be a paid service for everyone, at a price-point much less than $8?

I used to and still like Elon, I've followed him for a while now and although he does a do questionable things from time to time, he doesn't deserve all the hate he now gets on reddit. Most people used to like him, he wasn't a fake billionaire and never had a PR team, so he's authentic. He's also relatable and has a fantastic sense of humour. All you'd need to do is watch him on a recent podcast to see all he wants to do is make life better for humanity. 

So why all the Elon hate? I've watched the general opinion of reddit change so drastically over the last year or so. My friend, who also liked Elon, said he's beginning to change his opinion. I asked him what changed in the last year and he said he didn't know. I think reddit is a great platform for warping the opinion of the masses.

Hi - 
Is anyone else here a Tesla owner who is troubled enough by some of Musk's political positions, and/or by company practices, that they are considering having to sell their Tesla vehicle?  Or are some others here already avoiding a Tesla purchase for these reasons?  I realize that there will be people who either do not care, or who like Musk's positions and the company's behavior so that it is an incentive to purchase rather than a headwind.

In my case, I actually like Musk ""on balance"".  I'm grateful that he had the vision and tenacity to fight through the hurdles and provide consumers with an option to just accepting what the traditional auto companies were deigning to sell us.  And I still like him, on balance.  But sometimes people we like do unacceptable things, and, among a few other things, Musk's decision to cozy up to Ron DeSantis, along with his failure to make completely clear that he disavows the broad-daylight ongoing effort to end the rule of law in the US that includes pretending 2020 election was ""stolen""... Musk's failure in this area is unacceptable.  (If he wants to vote Republican on occasion, then whatever, but voting for election deniers or for those who are their allies?.... no).

Anyway, I wish that he would come to his senses, but so far it hasn't happened.  There is very little choice out there right now for non-Tesla electric vehicles that are comparable in price, quality, availability, to the one I'm driving, and which are made in America.  So, I'm trying to sit tight and see what to do next, without costing myself $10k-$40k getting out of my Tesla and into the next vehicle, just because Elon Musk took a decision not to extend his legendary intelligence and vision into a few of his political comments.",Do Musk's positions and practices lead you to consider selling your Tesla?,"Hi -

He says that one of the main reasons for charging is to avoid bots on the site. But obviously he cannot expect all of the members of Twitter to subscribe to this service, only a very small percentage will do it, which means that it will not in the slightest solve the bot-problem. 

I think this has the potential to send Twitter down a spiral where fewer and fewer people use the platform. Facebook only became succesful because it was free. 

There is no doubt Elon is one of our times greatest businessmen, and that is why I just cannot fathom this decision. Why so soon?

11xugyt,21/3/23 21:03,"10 Reasons to believe Elon Musk is a CIA Operative

Here are the 10 main reasons to believe that Elon Musk is a CIA Operative:

**First of all: Elon Musk is a False Counter-Culture figure**

Elon Musk has always acted as though he is 'anti-establishment' - doing things such as questioning the C-19 official story, amongst others. Yet Tesla produces machines for a C-19 vaccine. How is this 'anti-establishment'? It is likely he has been planted by the CIA to appear to be 'fighting the machine' whilst he's actually working for it. (And making it, too)

**2. Elon Musk in the early '00s.**

Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital firm, were interested in Elon during 2001/2002. Mike Griffin CIA executive, travelled to Russia with Musk during this time and their intention was to buy ICBMs. But they never made this deal with the Russians and so Musk decided to form SpaceX. His prospective business partner Mike Griffin from the CIA was then appointed as NASA administrator, and was awarded a $400 million contract to SpaceX - before it had even launched a rocket.

[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX#History](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX#History)

**3. Elon Musk's Businesses Are the CIA's Wet Dreams**

Elon Musk has three main companies:

**Starlink**

A satellite grid that completely covers the globe. If everyone is on the 'grid' of satellites (which will most likely happen eventually) everyone will be completely trackable at all times, anywhere. Especially if people are linked to NeuraLink. They are basically 'spy satellites'

**Neuralink**

A chip surgically planted into your brain that can upload and download information, turning you into a transhuman. This will not only create trans-humans but also a divide between trans-humans and humans. The trans-humans will have many advantages due to the downloading and uploading of all information whilst the humans will remain organic, but will be heavily disadvantaged in a capitalist society as a result.

Elon Musk has never mentioned that these two technologies will be 'linked' - but since they have the names Star**LINK** and Neura**LINK**, and Starlink provides internet whilst Neuralink requires it, you can be damn sure these things *will* be linked.

**Tesla**

Remotely-hijackable cars that can be controlled by internet connection (and by StarLink eventually I am sure) you go off-course? Tesla realigns it. You break the law? Tesla drives you to the police station. Speeding? Tesla slows you down. You do anything that isn't within the rules of Tesla and the law and you no longer have choice, your choices are *controlled.*

Of course, there is also the Tesla Robot which is currently being worked on. It doesn't take a genius to work out why the CIA would love this to become a reality. The implications of a Robot that appears and acts exactly like a human are phenomenal.

*These 3 businesses have CIA written all over them.*

**4. Further NeuraLink Breakdown**

NeuraLink is the true beginning of transhumanism, which will be the final step that turns us from being human into becoming something other than human. It will finally connect us to the 'hive mind' - through StarLink - and ultimately *disconnect* us from the soul.

One of the main reasons for this is that more people these days are finding spirituality. People are realising how bad technology is for the soul and are steadily starting to distance themselves from it - deleting social media, using phones less, following spiritual teachers, gurus, religions etc. If they convince us to install tech such as NeuraLink into our minds, it pulls us as far away from spirituality as possible and turns us into transhumans. Transhumans cannot ascend or go to heaven because they are *artificially influenced*. The more people who have Neauralink, in their eyes - the better.

**5. 'Elon Musk Is Not Your Friend' Documentary Removed From Rumble**

There was a documentary on Rumble that gained a huge amount of traction but has since been removed.. why was it removed?

It explained how Elon Musk is a fraud and CIA/WEF puppet who never actually invented anything and got rich from elitist money.

If anyone has a copy of this documentary anywhere please let me know as it needs to be reposted.

**6. Elon Musk and the New World**

**7. Elons Ex-Partner Grimes**

By now most of us know about the music video she released pre-covid of people in pandemic masks as well as her cryptic photo of an ancient stone artifact with some additional symbols added: vaccine needles and UFO's.

There has also been mentions of her being a witch, ties to the occult, elitist parents, CIA background etc although this is all speculation and nothing has been proven. But due to her cryptic postings prediction COVID and the jab, I wouldn't be surprised if some, if not all of this is true.

And then of course Elon Musk tweets an image about finding out his partner was a CIA actor planted to dissuade him from being part of the counter-culture movement.

This not only screams ""my ex was CIA"" but when we keep in mind everything else, it also screams ""I am a shill for the CIA fronting as a counter-culture figure""

**8. Elon Musk is a Pentagon Contractor**

Elon Musk's SpaceX won 2 Pentagon contracts for nearly $160 million in order to launch missions with its Falcon 9 rockets.

""The Pentagon announced Tuesday that it had signed two contracts with Elon Musk's space company, SpaceX, for more than $159 million.

Under the agreements, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets will launch two separate missions, the US Department of Defence said in a [statement](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2530911//).

The two contracts come to $159.7 million and are expected to be completed by the end of 2023, the Pentagon said. It did not disclose the cost of each individual mission."" -[Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-spacex-won-two-pentagon-contracts-launch-military-rockets-2021-3?r=US&IR=T)

This is going to be a bit of a rant, but I would like some other people's opinion on this.

Elon Musk has been seriously pissing me off ever since he bought Twitter. Just recently he was harassing a now former Twitter employee for being disabled. Musk has since apologized but I feel like he only did so because somebody from his pr told him to. I get that it's very common for us Aspies to do things that are rude but normally when we do so it's for something small, not something like this.

Elon has also been pushing far right conspiracy theories like the myth about the world population going down rather than up, which is why he has so many kids. I've heard some people saying that he doesn't really spend that much time with his kids, but I can't really confirm that except for the case of his trans daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson. He's even COVID a ""specific form of the common cold.""

He doesn't spend anymore time with Jenna and he blames communism for it. He says that he supports trans people but calls pronouns an esthetic nightmare. If he actually did support trans people than he would spend more time with Jenna.

Musk has also reinstated the accounts of multiple right-wing extremists like Marjorie Green, Andrew Tate and the Babylon Bee. He also replies to accounts like Libs of TikTok, an account that's well known for getting people doxxed, and he promises that Twitter will be a better place (for them).

I've also read that he's one of the worst people to work for (most rich people like him usually are). During a production problem a Tesla he told his employees that they weren't smart enough to be working on the problem. I've also heard that employees will avoid walking past his office or where ever he's, especially when he's having a bad day, in order to avoid being yelled at or possibly fired on a whim.

But, it's still drastically better to have an organization that coordinates and pools information while being able to provide structural, organizational support. See lots of outbreaks in Africa where they did excellent work.

""While other station owners typically use ""must-run"" segments to push station promotions, Sinclair has used required programming to push conservative-leaning stances into its local broadcasts.

""The must-runs look like they are part of the news,"" David Twedell, business manager of a local camera workers' union in Seattle told The Washington Post. ""And they're clearly not.""

jd03mbg,2023-03-20 21:27:40,"> Twitter defines monetizable daily active usage or users (mDAU) as people, organizations, or other accounts who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter on any given day through twitter.com, Twitter applications that are able to show ads, or paid Twitter products, including subscriptions. Average mDAU for a period represents the number of mDAU on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in mDAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active total accounts. To calculate the year-over-year change in mDAU, we subtract the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average mDAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Additionally, our calculation of mDAU is not based on any standardized industry methodology and is not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our measures of mDAU growth and engagement may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology.

Second - your not advertising to people that don't use the app for a few minutes. The industry standard is for a user to see the ad 20 times before they consider the material in a ad. This requires real usage, not momentary usage. 

This is why Twitter failed in the past. Its not worth serving an ad to people only using the app in 30 second segments to read single tweets linked to by other.

jcyn0ih,2023-03-20 15:49:12,"Roger that.

But just to clarify, we actually ""can't"" pull from the other states and keep ERCOT free of federal regulations.  The feds control interstate commerce and they consider the transfer of power from one state to another to be in their sphere of control.  As long as we refuse to connect to either the East or West grid, Texas can control its grid as it sees fit, independent of the Feds.  So it's not a matter of ""can"" we, its ""will"" we.  And the people in charge have spoken.

Having said that, theres actually a couple of connects to Oklahoma I think and maybe one to Mexico.  And El Paso isn't using the Texas grid at all which is why they didn't suffer blackouts during the freeze.  I'm not sure how those are being viewed by the Feds or why they are allowed as exceptions. 

But, if we ""did"" pull power it would have helped quite a bit.  Our generation capacity even when diminished was ""almost"" enough, so we actually didn't need that much.  It's impossible to know for sure, but its safe to say at least some of the people who froze to death could have survived.

Would it even be possible to pull power for a state the size of Texas?.
Yes it would help but not sure it wouldn't solve?

Btw, lot of good answers.

With a man-made necessity of electricity if it goes down, it's always going to be a man-made problem so I don't really blame people for these types of outages.

At least to me it's always the process. A group of people didn't imagine an outage of this size with legislators throwing terms like negligence and jail time at them. 
If they did things would have went down differently since nobody wants their organization or their future in it questioned.

We hope this issue will be lessened in the future.

jcxc7z2,2023-03-20 07:59:02,"First, I'm sorry for what you went through.  But this was not because of a severe storm.  It was negligence.

Texas officials had been warned and knew the power plants would fail with severe winter storms.  But since the Texas grid doesn't connect to other states, the federal regulations which would have been applicable weren't enforceable.  ERCOT left the choice to winterize up to the individual power companies.  And instead of doing so, many chose to just sit back and see what happens. 

Wind turbines need winterizing as well and weren't for much the same reasons, but they at best only supply about 20% of generation capacity.  Nat Gas plants have the lion share of power production in Texas at about 50%.  Problems with Nat Gas plants will hurt power generation more.  We could deal with failure of wind (16GW), we couldn't deal with failure of Nat Gas (30GW) let alone the failure of both.

Natural gas condenses from a gas to liquid at like -260F.  So cold should not be an issue, but water vapor rises with the nat gas and then freezes in the pumps and pipes.  Its an easy fix, just remove the water vapor.  This can be done with glycogen.  It's not new and is one of the cheaper ways to do it.  No water vapor, no ice, no problem.

But since a good chunk of the nat gas facilities did not choose to winterize, the nat gas flow began to falter and power generation went down just as people, like yourself, needed it most.

The cold was not the problem.  It was ""not preparing for the cold"" that was the problem.

Additionally, we couldn't pull power from other states to cover our shortages because ERCOT wants to stay free from federal regulations at all costs.  So you sat for 4 days without power or heat and had your water pipes bust.  Yay freedom!

Gov Abbot doesn't want a third freeze failure.  He couldn't keep blaming renewables and ignoring Nat Gas problems when the facts are out there.  And he knows he might not be reelected if it happens again under his watch.  So he pushed for the Texas Railroad Commission, which for some reason regulates the natural gas industry, to face stiff fines if they didn't winterize their facilities.  No more honor system. 

From what I've read nearly all of the 320+ power plants have been winterized.

jcv7y5w,2023-03-19 20:33:10,">How is the reach increased if it is $xx per account?

It's really not hard to understand. Let's say that you make an average of $200 per victim, then it means you only have to get one more pigeon per year for Twitter Blue to be profitable.

Also, the extra visibility provided by Twitter Blue will make it easier to reach more people, and the blue checkmark will help to get the trust of unsuspecting victims.

For state actors, it's even easier to explain : 8$/month per account for 100 000 accounts is 5.6 million per year. That's a drop in a bucket for a state like Russia or the US, and when you try to influence people, an increased reach is invaluable.

Edit :

>If someone wants to drop X thousands of dollars for a bot army, screw it, make money from it.

https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/930195

Trans is not a new phenomenon at all, the acknowledgement of trans people is well documented through history and the first instances of gender-affirming surgery go back to the Weimar Republic. Most recently, DSM-5 coins the term ""gender dysphoria"" since 2013, replacing DSM-4 which labeled the same concept as ""Gender Identity Disorder"" since 1994.  Your personal knowledge about something you refuse to learn about does not equal the existence of the subject itself. 

About detransition: When you count up ""detransitioners"", you have to first exclude those questioned their gender at some point, but never got to the point of actually opting for hormone therapy. Out of those who stop taking hormone therapy you have to exclude those who do so out of social pressure and would desire to continue their treatment. The result is that the vast majority of people forced to the irreversible damage of going through puberty regrets doing so.

But even then, all that conversation is nonsense when talking about social trabsitioning. Not allowing youths to use preferred pronouns and dresscode is absolutely nothing but deliberate desire to inflict pain on them.",,,elonmusk,potato_devourer,,6.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/11t7ve1/elon_musk_sparks_debate_on_medical_interventions/,https://www.httnews.com/business/elon-musk-sparks-debate-on-medical-interventions-for-minors-and-gender-identity,,,reddit_cmt,,

How do you even get these data? Trans is a new phenomenon. The current batch of trans kids are essentially guinea pigs so how can they go beyond the level of hypothesis when you don't have enough data? 

The root of the problem is this: people think that we should accept the feelings of trans people as truth. I think therefore I am. What's the problem? People can change their mind.
