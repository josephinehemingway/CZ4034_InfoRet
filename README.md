# ElonSearch
## CZ4034_InfoRet Group 25

In this project, our team built an information retrieval system for social media content related to Elon Musk, with sentiment analysis on the publicâ€™s opinion of him. Our team crawled a text corpus containing Tweets and Reddit content, created a search engine to query the crawled corpus and performed sentiment analysis on them. This report will document the steps taken in crawling the data, the development of the search engine as well as the classification task for the sentiment analysis.

Team members who contributed to the success of the project:
- Josephine Agatha Hemingway
- Paing Khantt Lin
- Lim Wei Ze
- Lim ZhengWei Trevor
- Sim Shi Qian
