(/Edit)

The interview was first attempted to post in this subreddit. It seemed peefectly topical.

The lawyer-turned-journalist that broke the Snowden story and brought down the right wing government in Brazil interviewed Matt Taibbi.

The post here was denied. I assumed some automod regex by this sub's moderators, so I attempted a post in a sub I moderate and it turns out it is a *site-wide* administrative ban.

Look crypto bros, **CRYPTOgraphy** lets spam Twitter with this as a Use case (sarcasm)

In basic terms: Open AI is adding a watermark to text generated from GPT, so it's easier to spot AI-generated works.

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI‚Äôs GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

*not AI toying with students‚Äô emotions üò≠*

But on a more serious note, it's inevitable that a workaround will be created, this one should also be a nice battle between AI developers and People who want to use uncredited work ( I think they are called pirates??? i don‚Äôt know).

352,zm9vy5,So let me understand something,"So let me get this straight, Elon's little kid was flying in Elon's jet. His live location was made easy to reach and was amplified on a page dedicated to sharing Elon's current location. 
The kid was actually location tracked, and due to that, a stalker blocked and jumped on the hood of the car the kid was in. And some of you guys are claiming this amplified public tracking is considered free speech?

Flight info is made public for air control and safely monitoring air traffic, not for people to be able to track and stalk other people.

It is possible to look up someone's address and private estates with ease if you have his full name. Should that mean that sharing a person's current address publicly and amplifying it should be okay? Is it not a serious safety risk that infringes on your privacy and rights?

What would you do if it were you and your children who were tracked and stalked like this?

378,zjn9rq,Elon musks quest for human power,"



It was a dark and stormy night, and Elon Musk sat alone in his laboratory, hunched over a table filled with strange and exotic equipment. For weeks, he had been working on a secret project, fueled by his insatiable hunger for power and his desire to push the boundaries of science and technology.

As the storm raged outside, Musk's eyes glowed with a mad light as he mixed and measured various chemicals and compounds, his hands moving with the precision of a surgeon. Finally, with a triumphant grin, he poured the last of the ingredients into a glowing beaker and watched as it began to bubble and hiss.

""At last,"" he whispered, ""the elixir of life. The key to unlocking the limitless energy of the human soul.""

With a trembling hand, he lifted the beaker to his lips and drank the glowing liquid, feeling its power surge through his veins. In an instant, he was transformed, his senses heightened and his body infused with a new and terrifying strength.

But as he looked around his laboratory, he realized that he was not alone. The storm had brought with it a group of unsuspecting victims, and as they stumbled into the room, they were met with the horrifying sight of Elon Musk, his eyes glowing with a demonic light as he lunged at them, his teeth bared in a twisted grin.

""You will be my energy,"" he snarled, as he began to feast on the flesh of the terrified people, his hunger growing with each bite.

In the end, no one was able to stop him, and Elon Musk continued his reign of terror, feeding on the people of the world in his quest for limitless power. And as he grew stronger and more powerful, he became a monster, a creature of pure evil that only the bravest and strongest could hope to defeat.",elonmusk,Klutzy_Information79,0,0,0.19,0,1670819989.0,reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/zjn9rq/elon_musks_quest_for_human_power/,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/zjn9rq/elon_musks_quest_for_human_power/,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Art'}]",5

391,ziackh,"The Twitter Files, shows a need for basic digital rights to speech.","The largest takeaway from the ongoing Twitter Files, that I don't hear being talked about, is that it points to a need for nation states to amend or implement **digital rights** related to social media.

What is being release is morally reprehensible, but not necessarily absolutely illegal. As it stands now, Twitter is a company, and they ott to be allowed to support whatever political ideology their employees, managers, shareholder, etc... believe in.  Just like, if coke wanted to support one candidate and Pepsi wanted to support the other, that's their own prerogative.

I see an issue with that though, Coke and Pepsi, their product is sugar water... Whereas the product of Twitter, Facebook and other Social Media platforms is for better lack of a word: ""A digital representation of a public space"".
* A direct message would be akin to having a conversation with a friend at their house.
* A Tweet or Reddit post is similar to having a conversation in a park.

For the first time in thousands of years, man has figured out a way for something physical to be replicated as a parallel universe; cyberspace, if you will.

Would it not be wise, to transcribe and patch this freedom to fit in with the modern digital world of today?

I know I am being naive, but I wish for a forum for like minded people to share comments and post about Elon in a respectful way, sure, open criticism too, we all know that Elon is only human and does stupid thing too. 

But the level of hatred, nonsensical criticism towards anything Elon related is just going over the charts, and what was once a subreddit about Elon for the fan base and regulars becomes no longer.

To avoid this, maybe we should appeal to the moderators to look into it and see what could be done, if anything at all.

440,zcgf2u,The Twitter / Musk Arb Trade,"Hey folks,

I'm not sure if you might be interested in a podcast that details the saga of the Twitter purchase and the drama around Elon's acquisition of the platform. I interviewed two investors who were long Twitter during the legal battle, along with a lawyer that covers the Delaware Court of Chancery.

I think that the real key to the trade was to see Elon for who he really is, and not a caricature that has been cooked up by either his fans or haters. Also, as I mention in the episode, I think Elon made the trade especially fun.

I'm curious if any of the people on this sub got involved in this trade, since you likely have a lot of Elon-relevant knowledge that would have been pretty important.

The story kind of begins in January of this year and then concludes in late October, so it doesn't cover anything that's happened since he closed. Seems like it's way too early to really know what will happen with the site. Would love to see him bring the company public again so that all of the hot-take artists could either bet on the future of the company, or shut up. There's just a lot of bluster from people who have injected their wishes for what will happen into their analysis of the costs/revenue stuff.

(Outside of this episode my show more generally deals with risk takers, like gamblers and investors).

Twitter is addictive especially when you have a ton of followers who kinda act like YES men to everything you tweet and Elon was stuck in that trap. The way I envision him tweeting right now is smoking confirmation (and other cognitive) bias. We all know what happened ever since he bought a 9% stake and he went back and forth (like complete 180s, and so do most of his fans and haters) on multiple decisions, issues and statements. 

In the guise of restoring free speech (NP Hard problem), he is somehow damaging his reputation, burning his/others' valuable time, tweeting and deleting extremist views, asking people to be civil and then post troll tweets, and most importantly dividing the nation even further which is kinda ironic and frustrating. Whether you hate him or love him, don't you think we must not get into the trap of social media echo chambers and become more polarized than we already are?

I did a bit of research, and was surprised to learn how close is SpaceX to making a phone. 

Firstly, Starlink terminals are basically satellite phones. Sure, they're bulky, but the core functionality is the same.

Secondly, SpaceX has already made some steps into this direction. A few months ago (August 2022), SpaceX announced a partnership with T-Mobile, the second-largest wireless carrier in the US. Judging by the announcements, SpaceX wants to add some cellular connectivity to Starlink terminals.

Thirdly, cellular phones is not a rocket science (heh). It's an old tech. You can build your own phone with a few cheap off-the-shelf components. The phone will be bulky and will look like a DIY contraption, but it will work. There are dozens of manuals on how to do that. 

Fourthly, there are several small companies that make high-quality open-source cell phones (this includes open-source hardware). SpaceX can adopt their specs, or buy the entire company.

532,z4cfi6,Consquences of The Twitter Deal," If Twitter somehow survives this, he then has to deal with the shitload of liability that the non GDPR compliant, unsecured website will bring him. If Twitter just crashes, and that's it, it would be a blessing in disguise for Elon. If Twitter survives for much longer, more than just his poorly leveraged debt, will kick his ass.   


 

His Twitter ownership is back by leveraged Tesla shares. If Twitter crashes, his creditors get his Tesla shares. If *Tesla* crashes, Twitter's debt becomes even more difficult to service and his creditors may demand even more Tesla shares. Basically, if *anything* crashes, Elon is fucked. If everything, by some miracle, survives, then Twitter is still stuck with its insane debt service obligations, and basically acts like an anchor around Elon's neck, since it'll keep Twitter from turning any serious profits.

And given his management of Twitter so far, there is a possibility, albeit remote, that large stakeholders might be able to argue Elon managed Twitter in bad faith as the CEO - which could let them ""pierce the vail"", to go after Elon's personal wealth directly, in the event of a bankruptcy of Twitter.

Oh, and none of this even touches upon what kind of impact this might have on Elon's management/ownership of SpaceX. All those deals are private. All we can reasonably infer is that SpaceX isn't turning a profit (because if it were, Elon and the other investors would be taking it public so they could get their return on investment). For all we know, the Twitter deal is backed with SpaceX shares, too. Or there could be stipulations in SpaceX's charter, or Elon's contract, that could see him lose control of SpaceX if Twitter goes sideways.  


 Spacex is pretty much just funded by the government as a fucking handout lol  so we don't need to talk about that  


 And SpaceX going public would be the worst thing at this point in time. Part of what makes them so unique and successful is their ability to rapidly iterate on the fly (pun maybe intended) via testing to failure (and they're not afraid to fail) without fear of repercussions by shareholders. We have the luxury of following practically every move SpaceX is making for Starship development in South Texas including vehicle design, testing, and sometimes destructive testing. This is incredibly rare in that industry.

Everyone wants more feedback and to grow their channel and this is the perfect way to accomplish that. $8 a month could help increase visibility, but I think a second/third tier for even more visibility, which is more like $40, or even $200 a month, could help fund Twitter's costs even further.

1150,z15n0p,Just some facts around large-scale systems,"First some disclaimers:

1. I have never worked for Twitter and outside of running into some of their folks in conferences, I have no direct knowledge of anyone there.
2. I am not interested in speculating what will be the future of the platform, I am just seeing a huge amount of misinformed opinions and I thought I can offer my perspective as someone who has worked on large-scale systems their whole career.

Cool?

Alright so let's start with a comment on Twitter being bloated. I have no knowledge of their organizational structure and I think it's a safe assumption to say that neither most people commenting one way or another. I can say with certainty that Twitter did not have 7500 engineers. Probably less than half of that number were involved in anything directly technical, and the rest were supporting and business departments (like marketing, legal, compliance, support, vendor and customer relations, HR, training, etc. etc.).

Several thousand people may seem a lot until you realize the scope of this operation. This is a global company with datacenters around the world. I would guess 3 in the US ~~(minimally 2 West and East) and minimally 1 in Europe, 1 in India and at least 1 in Asia maybe Singapore...If they had a presence in China they would also have at least a dedicated datacenter there too.~~

`Edit: I know no one comes back to read these things, but for the sake accuracy I looked up Twitter's infrastructure and from what I can find they have 3 physical datacenters in the US and contracts with AWS and Google(GCP).` 

The technical groups would also be separated into specialists. Frond-end development is fundamentally different than backend development which is fundamentally different than operations such as network and infrastructure. Those teams would also split into specialists for each platform. Android, iOS and browser would have their own dedicated teams, probably multiple of each as the engineers are also rarely experts in UIX for example. There would be multiple teams dedicated to analytics for business and operational purposes staffed with data scientists. Security definitely had its own organization with perhaps also divided between security development and security operations. How large each organization was would depend on how much custom security solutions they developed vs. using known products.

For every critical function and interface, ideally you need separate teams and people for both security and speed. You cannot rely on a single person for a critical function because things happen to people...they get sick, they get hit by busses, they have kids, they might even want to go on vacation.

I can go on, however the point I wanted to make is that it's not so simple throwing numbers around about how many people are needed to both run and enhance that platform. Maybe the layoffs and resignations were even across everything, maybe they were only targeted for certain teams. If the numbers are indeed upwards of 80 to 90% across all teams, then the development speed and perhaps operational stability may be at risk, even if there are still people who can handle each are, if they are the only ones left with their expertise, it's a huge risk to the organization. You never want to be one-deep on any given area.

I won't go into much of the discussion about twitter still being the same since the layoffs because that's just silly. The people working there weren't hamsters on wheels that once they left the wheels would immediately stop spinning. The clues about the health of the systems will be revealed in the coming weeks and months. In operations when the next outage happens. We will see the root cause and how long it will take to resolve. In security, same deal. In development we will see how new features are rolled out and whether they are buggy, etc. and of course in the long run we will see how those things are addressed and whether they are improving.

=============================

On the technical side there is just a tsunami of bad takes from ""put it on the cloud"" to ""this is a simple app"" and I feel that they fall into fundamentally 3 categories of people (if I exclude those who are trolling):

1. Non-IT people making comments from their experience as a user
2. IT people who haven't worked on globally large-scale systems
3. Non-Technical IT people who may have worked on large-scale systems but from a management perspective or never had to solve for the engineering problems at that scale.

This topic alone could fill a dozen books, but let me just say that any simple operation scaled to several billion operations per hour across the globe is not trivial to solve and will break in very unexpected ways. There are also counter-intuitive scenarios where systems which are optimized for speed at that scale will actually become **slower** if the call volume is decreased. There isn't a single person or skillset which can solve this on their own, you need deep experts in network, in storage, in cashing, in several specific RFCs and this isn't something that is taught in schools because it's only useful for less than 100 companies worldwide. It's actually a huge testament to the geniuses who came up with the original specifications for things like HTTP because they never envisioned in their wildest dreams how the internet would evolve and the fact these protocols have been able to (mostly) scale to this level is honestly mind-blowing. It's like if the Wright Brothers' initial engine design could be used almost unchanged in today's fighter jets.

`Edit: One more edit here since I got called out on my tech geekiness and I didn't have a chance to respond to that comment before the user deleted it. There are indeed different kinds of network experts and I don't pretend to be a network engineer, I have to call on the adults when it comes to WAN specific considerations.` 

`Also, when I mention expertise in RFCs I was just simplifying because no one is interested in reading another 4 paragraphs on how do you go about designing and implementing a custom solution based on an RFC specification while also being aware of the 19 other vendors who have done the same but all in slightly different ways and will sit there and play dumb when you tell them that actually they aren't spec compliant since they aren't including an attribute that is marked as MANDATORY by the spec.`

This is already a huge wall of text so I don't want to geek out over the technical section (I am happy to if anyone has questions in the comments), but I wanted to especially call this out for my IT brothers and sisters because some of these comments make you look foolish to those with experience in these fields.",elonmusk,FacilelySisyphean,147,0,0.87,147,1669054081.0,reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/z15n0p/just_some_facts_around_largescale_systems/,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/z15n0p/just_some_facts_around_largescale_systems/,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'General'}]",101

Federal minimum wage is currently sitting at $7.25 an hour in the U.S. and if you worked a full time 40 hour a week job that roughly translates to around $15,080 a year.

If you never rose above that wage you would end up making $633,360 in 42 years, which is the average amount of time a person tends to work in U.S. currently.

At that rate Elon could have paid the entire life time of 69,470 workers wages, that's nearly the entire population of Canton Ohio.

By going through with the deal, he gets the access to the data and time needed to prove his claims.  

He can then go back and sue for fraud in the transaction and other legal claims that Twitter wasn't what it claimed to be (far more bots than originally claimed, falsifying financials, etc).  Possibly getting Twitter either for far less than he originally paid for it or getting it for free after all the legal battle is over with.   

I suspect he found something big and is trying to keep control of it.  I wouldn't be surprised if a new legal claim is filed by Musk against the previous management of Twitter before the end of the year.

Every time you do any of this, remember that you have more in common with them than you have with him. Put yourself in their shoes, because you will never be in his.

Personally, I cringe every time a manager yells at a waiter in front of me. Every company I ever worked for -- every single one, even when I worked minimum wage -- has always made it a policy never to let drama air out in front of the customers.

1347,yniyn0,Any newspapers reflecting Musk running Twitter positively?,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of Elon Musk, I feel like when you hear him talk, hear his ideas and viewpoints, and see the things he‚Äôs done, you feel like he‚Äôs a person that‚Äôs actually thinking rigorously and systematically and is a very creative problem solver who analyzes a situation extremely thoroughly to try to figure out how to resolve obstructions and make significant leaps of progress. I have always been behind him taking over Twitter from the start. When he said he would make Twitter more transparent and open source some of the Tweet promotion algorithms, it sounded like the democratic dream of free software advocates - moving in the opposite direction of Facebook, a tool that uses you, Twitter could become a neutral tool, a service, which you have way more freedom, clarity, control and understanding about how it works, what the rules are, and have the freedom to navigate those rules more to your own liking, like maybe finding ways to filter out content you don‚Äôt want to see.

As soon as he took over I was as excited and inspired as ever before. I think I saw that Twitter already changed its moderation a bit, like publically posting the actual rules behind moderation and so on? (Or was that there before?)

Every one of his Tweets talking about his plans has made good sense to me. He‚Äôs one of the most accomplished businesspeople in the world. The second he lands, it‚Äôs like, the master is here, let‚Äôs see how he does things differently. He establishes a new committee which is based on way more systematic and philosophical principles for what should be moderated and why. He realizes there are severe economic problems in the company‚Äôs functioning and takes bold, fearless, drastic changes like immediately establishing a new revenue stream (Twitter Blue) and slashing deadweight, literally firing half the staff and multiple executives whose work style he doesn‚Äôt like.

This is a company in the hands of a master. It‚Äôs like when you wonder how a three star Michelin chef cooks an omelette. You will always be surprised because in some ways it might surprise you that it‚Äôs quite simple, but you are aware how every choice they make speaks to how deliberate their choices are, how authentic, drawing from deep internal thought processes.

I have been weirdly taken aback seeing consistently negative press about this. Late night talk show hosts, New York Times, and others, are peddling a story that seems like political tribalism because their constituency wants to be anti-billionaires or something. They keep reporting on the rise in extremism and misinformation, apparently condemnable or random actions like firing a lot of staff, or even just making fun of his ‚Äúsink‚Äù pun.

Is there any newspaper putting this in a positive light?

This project is designed to create a cinema, later on a network of cinemas where the main idea is similar to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa Drive-in cinema, but instead of a car cabin, ordinary home conditions (house, apartment, premises) are used with online access to the Internet. Coverage places are 30...60...180...560 places, but at the same time his houses are not released. One of the platforms is considered to be the created meta universe, which is increasingly entering modern life.

The main effect of presence is the ability to hear the audience as in a regular cinema hall, while enjoying the sound and picture of new movies without leaving home.

 This program implies the participation and involvement of both an audience with little knowledge of advanced technologies, and an audience that is passionate about the latest technologies and fashions of modern society.

  It is also planned to cooperate with major streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon prime, Hulu and information technology companies Meta Platforms ink., Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft. 

The development of the  project is expected, this is the distribution of technical kits and software for using the possibilities of online attractions without involving the meta universe, via the Internet.

You can also use ""smart sound speaker"" with software.

1387,ykvpmv,Why a Blue check mark is now $8 on Twitter and Elon Musk's Next Steps - A possible explanation:,"Is it likely Twitter is eventually going to be a paid service for everyone, at a price-point much less than $8?

Currently there are about 300K verified accounts on Twitter. The $8 fee would bring in a paltry 2.4million dollars every month - pocket change for a company with a 5 billion dollar annual revenue. So is the charge levied so eventually millions of people will buy the blue check mark for $8 a month - who would pay such a sum for a service like Twitter? I don't think that's the game here.

Elon's number 1 concern with Twitter has been to first make it free of spams and bots. But it doesnt make sense to charge money to blue check accounts if the aim is to reduce the number of spam accounts -  the bot problem has never been with blue check accounts, which are more or less regulated in the public eye.

Well, perhaps the $8 charge is not supposed to bring in revenue, nor do away with the bot problem right now. Perhaps, all it is supposed to do at the moment is **create the idea first** among the general public **that Twitter is going to be a paid service.** **For everyone**. Obviously the charge for the general public later will not be $8. It will have to be much, much less, to the tune of a dollar per month or even less. After a section of Twitter has been paying $8 for a while, it will not seem too much for most of us to shell out a dollar a month. It will seem fair. So instead of making everyone pay at once at different tiers (which many wouldn't because right now it is given that Twitter is, and supposed to be, free), change the idea of Twitter first.

Charging everyone a minimum sub fee will help with the bot problem significantly, as one would have to shell out thousands or millions of dollar every month to keep spam operations going. It will also generate significant revenue for Twitter - if at least 250 million of Twitter's 450 million accounts currently are real, and at least a 100 million accounts stay after the subscription modality is introduced - that is still a 100 million dollars a month of clean revenue. That money can be used to pay content creators, and will pay for the regulation of spam accounts or actual hate speech, even more.

A win-win on both ends. Not sure if this is exactly what will happen, but speculative business non-fiction is a fun genre!",elonmusk,BandicootKind705,0,0,0.41,0,1667462253.0,reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/ykvpmv/why_a_blue_check_mark_is_now_8_on_twitter_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/ykvpmv/why_a_blue_check_mark_is_now_8_on_twitter_and/,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Twitter'}]",31
1388,ykvi1o,All this hate for Elon,"I used to and still like Elon, I've followed him for a while now and although he does a do questionable things from time to time, he doesn't deserve all the hate he now gets on reddit. Most people used to like him, he wasn't a fake billionaire and never had a PR team, so he's authentic. He's also relatable and has a fantastic sense of humour. All you'd need to do is watch him on a recent podcast to see all he wants to do is make life better for humanity. 

So why all the Elon hate? I've watched the general opinion of reddit change so drastically over the last year or so. My friend, who also liked Elon, said he's beginning to change his opinion. I asked him what changed in the last year and he said he didn't know. I think reddit is a great platform for warping the opinion of the masses.

1393,yknmnp,Do Musk's positions and practices lead you to consider selling your Tesla?,"Hi - 
Is anyone else here a Tesla owner who is troubled enough by some of Musk's political positions, and/or by company practices, that they are considering having to sell their Tesla vehicle?  Or are some others here already avoiding a Tesla purchase for these reasons?  I realize that there will be people who either do not care, or who like Musk's positions and the company's behavior so that it is an incentive to purchase rather than a headwind.

In my case, I actually like Musk ""on balance"".  I'm grateful that he had the vision and tenacity to fight through the hurdles and provide consumers with an option to just accepting what the traditional auto companies were deigning to sell us.  And I still like him, on balance.  But sometimes people we like do unacceptable things, and, among a few other things, Musk's decision to cozy up to Ron DeSantis, along with his failure to make completely clear that he disavows the broad-daylight ongoing effort to end the rule of law in the US that includes pretending 2020 election was ""stolen""... Musk's failure in this area is unacceptable.  (If he wants to vote Republican on occasion, then whatever, but voting for election deniers or for those who are their allies?.... no).

Anyway, I wish that he would come to his senses, but so far it hasn't happened.  There is very little choice out there right now for non-Tesla electric vehicles that are comparable in price, quality, availability, to the one I'm driving, and which are made in America.  So, I'm trying to sit tight and see what to do next, without costing myself $10k-$40k getting out of my Tesla and into the next vehicle, just because Elon Musk took a decision not to extend his legendary intelligence and vision into a few of his political comments.",elonmusk,melville48,0,0,0.33,0,1667436571.0,reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/yknmnp/do_musks_positions_and_practices_lead_you_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/yknmnp/do_musks_positions_and_practices_lead_you_to/,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tesla'}]",35

1403,yjyvgf,Elon charging 8$ for Twitter subscription is beyond stupid,"I have been and still am a huge Elon fan. But holy moly, I cannot fathom this decision. It makes absolutely no sense in my opinion. 

He says that one of the main reasons for charging is to avoid bots on the site. But obviously he cannot expect all of the members of Twitter to subscribe to this service, only a very small percentage will do it, which means that it will not in the slightest solve the bot-problem. 

I think this has the potential to send Twitter down a spiral where fewer and fewer people use the platform. Facebook only became succesful because it was free. 

There is no doubt Elon is one of our times greatest businessmen, and that is why I just cannot fathom this decision. Why so soon? It might have made a tiny bit of sense if they had waited a year and we could see that the platform was adding new exciting features and that it started to flourish. There is absolutely no reason for a normal casual user to subscribe to this service.

In the case of Doge, Elon helped in making the price soar by his tweets.

It was unhealthy when his tweets was affecting the price at time.
If he sells market sees red moment,
If he says he is not buying bitcoin the market goes down.

After that tweets that even suggest he is out of crypto, the market never crashed.

2529,11xugyt,10 Reasons to believe Elon Musk is a CIA Operative,"Here are the 10 main reasons to believe that Elon Musk is a CIA Operative:

**First of all: Elon Musk is a False Counter-Culture figure**

Elon Musk has always acted as though he is 'anti-establishment' - doing things such as questioning the C-19 official story, amongst others. Yet Tesla produces machines for a C-19 vaccine. How is this 'anti-establishment'? It is likely he has been planted by the CIA to appear to be 'fighting the machine' whilst he's actually working for it. (And making it, too)

**2. Elon Musk in the early '00s.**

Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital firm, were interested in Elon during 2001/2002. Mike Griffin CIA executive, travelled to Russia with Musk during this time and their intention was to buy ICBMs. But they never made this deal with the Russians and so Musk decided to form SpaceX. His prospective business partner Mike Griffin from the CIA was then appointed as NASA administrator, and was awarded a $400 million contract to SpaceX - before it had even launched a rocket.

[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX#History](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX#History)

**3. Elon Musk's Businesses Are the CIA's Wet Dreams**

Elon Musk has three main companies:

**Starlink**

A satellite grid that completely covers the globe. If everyone is on the 'grid' of satellites (which will most likely happen eventually) everyone will be completely trackable at all times, anywhere. Especially if people are linked to NeuraLink. They are basically 'spy satellites'

**Neuralink**

A chip surgically planted into your brain that can upload and download information, turning you into a transhuman. This will not only create trans-humans but also a divide between trans-humans and humans. The trans-humans will have many advantages due to the downloading and uploading of all information whilst the humans will remain organic, but will be heavily disadvantaged in a capitalist society as a result.

Elon Musk has never mentioned that these two technologies will be 'linked' - but since they have the names Star**LINK** and Neura**LINK**, and Starlink provides internet whilst Neuralink requires it, you can be damn sure these things *will* be linked.

**Tesla**

Remotely-hijackable cars that can be controlled by internet connection (and by StarLink eventually I am sure) you go off-course? Tesla realigns it. You break the law? Tesla drives you to the police station. Speeding? Tesla slows you down. You do anything that isn't within the rules of Tesla and the law and you no longer have choice, your choices are *controlled.*

Of course, there is also the Tesla Robot which is currently being worked on. It doesn't take a genius to work out why the CIA would love this to become a reality. The implications of a Robot that appears and acts exactly like a human are phenomenal.

*These 3 businesses have CIA written all over them.*

**4. Further NeuraLink Breakdown**

NeuraLink is the true beginning of transhumanism, which will be the final step that turns us from being human into becoming something other than human. It will finally connect us to the 'hive mind' - through StarLink - and ultimately *disconnect* us from the soul.

One of the main reasons for this is that more people these days are finding spirituality. People are realising how bad technology is for the soul and are steadily starting to distance themselves from it - deleting social media, using phones less, following spiritual teachers, gurus, religions etc. If they convince us to install tech such as NeuraLink into our minds, it pulls us as far away from spirituality as possible and turns us into transhumans. Transhumans cannot ascend or go to heaven because they are *artificially influenced*. The more people who have Neauralink, in their eyes - the better.

**5. 'Elon Musk Is Not Your Friend' Documentary Removed From Rumble**

There was a documentary on Rumble that gained a huge amount of traction but has since been removed.. why was it removed?

It explained how Elon Musk is a fraud and CIA/WEF puppet who never actually invented anything and got rich from elitist money.

If anyone has a copy of this documentary anywhere please let me know as it needs to be reposted.

**6. Elon Musk and the New World**

Elon called for a one world government in January 2022

""Elon Musk and the WEF""

>In his talk at the WEF, Elon Musk discussed how society needs to work together to create some kind of world government. He stated that this would be necessary to address the challenges currently posed by climate change and artificial intelligence.

**7. Elons Ex-Partner Grimes**

By now most of us know about the music video she released pre-covid of people in pandemic masks as well as her cryptic photo of an ancient stone artifact with some additional symbols added: vaccine needles and UFO's.

There has also been mentions of her being a witch, ties to the occult, elitist parents, CIA background etc although this is all speculation and nothing has been proven. But due to her cryptic postings prediction COVID and the jab, I wouldn't be surprised if some, if not all of this is true.

And then of course Elon Musk tweets an image about finding out his partner was a CIA actor planted to dissuade him from being part of the counter-culture movement.

This not only screams ""my ex was CIA"" but when we keep in mind everything else, it also screams ""I am a shill for the CIA fronting as a counter-culture figure""

**8. Elon Musk is a Pentagon Contractor**

Elon Musk's SpaceX won 2 Pentagon contracts for nearly $160 million in order to launch missions with its Falcon 9 rockets.

""The Pentagon announced Tuesday that it had signed two contracts with Elon Musk's space company, SpaceX, for more than $159 million.

Under the agreements, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets will launch two separate missions, the US Department of Defence said in a [statement](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2530911//).

The two contracts come to $159.7 million and are expected to be completed by the end of 2023, the Pentagon said. It did not disclose the cost of each individual mission."" -[Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-spacex-won-two-pentagon-contracts-launch-military-rockets-2021-3?r=US&IR=T)

**10. Elon Musk Wore a Satannic Suit of Armour at an Elite Halloween Party** (Image of Baphomet on the Chest)

Now fair enough, this could be a joke. But when you consider all the other craziness he's clearly up to, I don't think it's that far-fetched to suggest that he wore this suit for 'a reason'....

2590,11qrkm7,"Elon Musk is making us all look bad, and I'm worried that NT people will think we're all like him","This is going to be a bit of a rant, but I would like some other people's opinion on this.

Elon Musk has been seriously pissing me off ever since he bought Twitter. Just recently he was harassing a now former Twitter employee for being disabled. Musk has since apologized but I feel like he only did so because somebody from his pr told him to. I get that it's very common for us Aspies to do things that are rude but normally when we do so it's for something small, not something like this.

Elon has also been pushing far right conspiracy theories like the myth about the world population going down rather than up, which is why he has so many kids. I've heard some people saying that he doesn't really spend that much time with his kids, but I can't really confirm that except for the case of his trans daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson. He's even COVID a ""specific form of the common cold.""

He doesn't spend anymore time with Jenna and he blames communism for it. He says that he supports trans people but calls pronouns an esthetic nightmare. If he actually did support trans people than he would spend more time with Jenna.

[https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2022/10/11/elon-musk-says-communism-caused-rift-transgender-daughter](https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2022/10/11/elon-musk-says-communism-caused-rift-transgender-daughter)

Musk has also reinstated the accounts of multiple right-wing extremists like Marjorie Green, Andrew Tate and the Babylon Bee. He also replies to accounts like Libs of TikTok, an account that's well known for getting people doxxed, and he promises that Twitter will be a better place (for them).

I've also read that he's one of the worst people to work for (most rich people like him usually are). During a production problem a Tesla he told his employees that they weren't smart enough to be working on the problem. I've also heard that employees will avoid walking past his office or where ever he's, especially when he's having a bad day, in order to avoid being yelled at or possibly fired on a whim.

Not to mention all the bigotry on Twitter has dramatically increased.

"" [The Center for Countering Digital Hate found](https://counterhate.com/blog/fact-check-musks-claim-about-a-fall-in-hate-speech-doesnt-stand-up-to-scrutiny/), in the week immediately following Musk's takeover, that use of the N-word tripled the 2022 average, anti-LGBTQ slurs were up between 39% and 53%, and antisemitic slurs rose 22%.¬†[The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/technology/twitter-hate-speech.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes)¬†antisemitic posts referring to Jews or Judaism soared more than 61 percent in the first two weeks while¬†[accounts supporting ISIS](https://gnet-research.org/2022/11/18/islamic-state-supporters-on-twitter-how-is-new-twitter-handling-an-old-problem/?utm_campaign=wp_the_technology_202&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_technology202)¬†came roaring back.""
