Yes there was confusion about what size droplets where aerosol. Many were politically motivated to make masks sound more effective than they were. That doesn't mean they were completely ineffective. As long as there was moisture inside the mask it means less got out.

Yes there was uncertainty about how much vaccination would reduce transmissibility. No that doesn't mean it did nothing to reduce transmissibility. There was also political motivation to make it seem less effective. People were using fears to make people more cautious than they really needed to be.

**The marching orders are coming from higher up than where partisans are looking** and if anything conservative media groups and commentators are less concerned of alternative news, for better or for worse, than their left-wing counterparts.

""Sinclair Broadcast Group was meant to be the new Fox News, a conservative media outlet that would become an even more vocal proponent of President Trump and his policies as it took control of local televisions from coast to coast. As Sinclair’s leaders forged ties with the White House, the company’s move to buy a rival group of TV stations at one point appeared assured.""

""Sinclair has been criticized in the past for its must-run editorial, accused of engineering public relations gambits favoring the Trump administration. In 2018, anchors across its stations were mandated to read a prepared script, some of which had warned viewers of “fake news” being perpetrated by mainstream outlets.""

""While other station owners typically use ""must-run"" segments to push station promotions, Sinclair has used required programming to push conservative-leaning stances into its local broadcasts.

""The must-runs look like they are part of the news,"" David Twedell, business manager of a local camera workers' union in Seattle told The Washington Post. ""And they're clearly not.""

Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump White House official and campaign surrogate who was hired last year as the company's ""chief political analyst,"" helms segments that often defend Trump and hammer on other Republican themes.""

Average mDAU for a period represents the number of mDAU on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in mDAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active total accounts. To calculate the year-over-year change in mDAU, we subtract the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average mDAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Additionally, our calculation of mDAU is not based on any standardized industry methodology and is not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our measures of mDAU growth and engagement may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology.

488,jcyn0ih,"Roger that.

But just to clarify, we actually ""can't"" pull from the other states and keep ERCOT free of federal regulations.  The feds control interstate commerce and they consider the transfer of power from one state to another to be in their sphere of control.  As long as we refuse to connect to either the East or West grid, Texas can control its grid as it sees fit, independent of the Feds.  So it's not a matter of ""can"" we, its ""will"" we.  And the people in charge have spoken.

Having said that, theres actually a couple of connects to Oklahoma I think and maybe one to Mexico.  And El Paso isn't using the Texas grid at all which is why they didn't suffer blackouts during the freeze.  I'm not sure how those are being viewed by the Feds or why they are allowed as exceptions. 

But, if we ""did"" pull power it would have helped quite a bit.  Our generation capacity even when diminished was ""almost"" enough, so we actually didn't need that much.  It's impossible to know for sure, but its safe to say at least some of the people who froze to death could have survived.

Personally, I'd love to have a solar roof and charge my own EV.  But my wife (who I love very much!) is a bit of a cheapskate.

With a man-made necessity of electricity if it goes down, it's always going to be a man-made problem so I don't really blame people for these types of outages.

At least to me it's always the process. A group of people didn't imagine an outage of this size with legislators throwing terms like negligence and jail time at them. 
If they did things would have went down differently since nobody wants their organization or their future in it questioned.

512,jcxc7z2,"First, I'm sorry for what you went through.  But this was not because of a severe storm.  It was negligence.

Texas officials had been warned and knew the power plants would fail with severe winter storms.  But since the Texas grid doesn't connect to other states, the federal regulations which would have been applicable weren't enforceable.  ERCOT left the choice to winterize up to the individual power companies.  And instead of doing so, many chose to just sit back and see what happens. 

Wind turbines need winterizing as well and weren't for much the same reasons, but they at best only supply about 20% of generation capacity.  Nat Gas plants have the lion share of power production in Texas at about 50%.  Problems with Nat Gas plants will hurt power generation more.  We could deal with failure of wind (16GW), we couldn't deal with failure of Nat Gas (30GW) let alone the failure of both.

Natural gas condenses from a gas to liquid at like -260F.  So cold should not be an issue, but water vapor rises with the nat gas and then freezes in the pumps and pipes.  Its an easy fix, just remove the water vapor.  This can be done with glycogen.  It's not new and is one of the cheaper ways to do it.  No water vapor, no ice, no problem.

But since a good chunk of the nat gas facilities did not choose to winterize, the nat gas flow began to falter and power generation went down just as people, like yourself, needed it most.

The cold was not the problem.  It was ""not preparing for the cold"" that was the problem.

Additionally, we couldn't pull power from other states to cover our shortages because ERCOT wants to stay free from federal regulations at all costs.  So you sat for 4 days without power or heat and had your water pipes bust.  Yay freedom!

Gov Abbot doesn't want a third freeze failure.  He couldn't keep blaming renewables and ignoring Nat Gas problems when the facts are out there.  And he knows he might not be reelected if it happens again under his watch.  So he pushed for the Texas Railroad Commission, which for some reason regulates the natural gas industry, to face stiff fines if they didn't winterize their facilities.  No more honor system. 

From what I've read nearly all of the 320+ power plants have been winterized.

It's really not hard to understand. Let's say that you make an average of $200 per victim, then it means you only have to get one more pigeon per year for Twitter Blue to be profitable.

Also, the extra visibility provided by Twitter Blue will make it easier to reach more people, and the blue checkmark will help to get the trust of unsuspecting victims.

For state actors, it's even easier to explain : 8$/month per account for 100 000 accounts is 5.6 million per year. That's a drop in a bucket for a state like Russia or the US, and when you try to influence people, an increased reach is invaluable.

Edit :

>If someone wants to drop X thousands of dollars for a bot army, screw it, make money from it.

https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/930195

Trans is not a new phenomenon at all, the acknowledgement of trans people is well documented through history and the first instances of gender-affirming surgery go back to the Weimar Republic. Most recently, DSM-5 coins the term ""gender dysphoria"" since 2013, replacing DSM-4 which labeled the same concept as ""Gender Identity Disorder"" since 1994.  Your personal knowledge about something you refuse to learn about does not equal the existence of the subject itself. 

About detransition: When you count up ""detransitioners"", you have to first exclude those questioned their gender at some point, but never got to the point of actually opting for hormone therapy. Out of those who stop taking hormone therapy you have to exclude those who do so out of social pressure and would desire to continue their treatment. The result is that the vast majority of people forced to the irreversible damage of going through puberty regrets doing so.

But even then, all that conversation is nonsense when talking about social trabsitioning. Not allowing youths to use preferred pronouns and dresscode is absolutely nothing but deliberate desire to inflict pain on them.",elonmusk,potato_devourer,6,0,6,1679189719.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/11t7ve1/elon_musk_sparks_debate_on_medical_interventions/,https://www.httnews.com/business/elon-musk-sparks-debate-on-medical-interventions-for-minors-and-gender-identity,t1_jcrjolz

Do you have a properly tested sample size that can be use for the population? Do you have consistency in not only the hypothesis or theories but the results as well. Are they verifiable as can the outcomes or conclusions of one study be proven? Are they replicable?

How do you even get these data? Trans is a new phenomenon. The current batch of trans kids are essentially guinea pigs so how can they go beyond the level of hypothesis when you don't have enough data? 

The root of the problem is this: people think that we should accept the feelings of trans people as truth. I think therefore I am. What's the problem? People can change their mind. If detransitioners are right then their transition is a mistake and if transition can be a mistake then the science is incomplete at best and flawed at worst. I personally feel that the doctors, the therapist, all the people advocating for transitioning of detransitioners should be sue to oblivion because they advocated for a mistake.
