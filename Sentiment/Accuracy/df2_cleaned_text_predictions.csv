Most of the misleading of the public was political,not scientific. Most scientists were open about what they didn't know, and politicians often errored more on the side of caution.

Yes there was confusion about what size droplets where aerosol. Many were politically motivated to make masks sound more effective than they were. That doesn't mean they were completely ineffective. As long as there was moisture inside the mask it means less got out.

Yes there was uncertainty about how much vaccination would reduce transmissibility. No that doesn't mean it did nothing to reduce transmissibility. There was also political motivation to make it seem less effective. People were using fears to make people more cautious than they really needed to be.

Your taking complex issues and trying to make them simple. The effectiveness of lockdowns was complicated by the local cultures and how people responded to lockdowns. I live in a place were restrictions were weaker, but more effective since the local culture lead to many people respecting the restrictions.

The fact is the medical systems were pushed to their breaking points, and doing nothing would have been vastly worse.
